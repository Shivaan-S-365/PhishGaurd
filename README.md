## � New Features

We've added several new tools to make PhishGuard more useful and interactive. Below is a quick summary, where to find the code, and how to try them locally.

### QR Code Scanner (/qr-scan)
- What: Upload an image (PNG/JPG) that contains a QR code. The app decodes the QR and extracts URLs or text content.
- Files: `phishguard/app/qr-scan/page.tsx`, `phishguard/components/ScannerForm.tsx` (used by the page).
- Backend API: FastAPI router at `ml_model/app/routers/qr_router.py` exposes POST /api/qr/scan which accepts an image file and returns the decoded QR result.
- Try it: Start the frontend (http://localhost:3000) and backend (http://localhost:8000). Open http://localhost:3000/qr-scan and upload a QR image.
- Note: The frontend `ScannerForm` currently sends requests to `http://localhost:8000/scan/qr/api/qr/scan` in the page — make sure the URL matches your backend routing (the backend route is `POST /api/qr/scan`).

### Admin Chat — Team Lead Dashboard (/admin-chat)
- What: A real-time admin dashboard for team leads to view and answer student questions submitted from the student chat. Includes stats, filtering, priority/status labels, and the ability to mark answers.
- Files: `phishguard/app/admin-chat/page.tsx`.
- Auth: The page checks an `ADMIN_UID` constant in the file to determine access — update this UID to match your admin account in Firebase.
- Try it: Sign in with the configured admin account in the frontend, then open http://localhost:3000/admin-chat to manage questions.

### Browser Extension (PhishGuard)
- What: A Chrome/Chromium extension that can block/monitor requests using the declarativeNetRequest ruleset.
- Files: `extension-build/manifest.json`, `extension-build/rules.json`, `extension-build/popup.html`.
- How to load: In Chrome/Edge go to Extensions → Load unpacked and point to the `extension-build/` folder. The extension uses `declarativeNetRequest` rules (see `rules.json`).
